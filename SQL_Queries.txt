1.Identify the top five aircraft that received the highest number of service transfers in the past year.

SELECT destination_aircraft_id AS aircraft_id, COUNT(*) AS transfer_count
FROM Audit_Log
WHERE action = 'Service Transfer'
AND timestamp >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())
GROUP BY destination_aircraft_id
ORDER BY transfer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

2.List all aircraft that had multiple service transfers within the same 30-day period.

SELECT
    destination_aircraft_id AS aircraft_id,
    COUNT(*) AS transfer_count,
    DATE(timestamp) AS transfer_date
FROM
    Audit_Log
WHERE
    action = 'Service Transfer'
    AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'  -- Filter for the last 30 days
GROUP BY
    destination_aircraft_id, DATE(timestamp)
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
